This CPU Support package enables the development for the iMCU microcontroller family using the [Crossworks development environment](https://rowley.co.uk/arm/index.htm) from Rowley. The package provides all needed data and information to enabled the Development Environment to compile and debug applications on the iMCU microcontroller
This Includes:

- CMSIS-Specific Code Files
- Memory-Map-Files
- Register-Descriptions for debugging
- Loader for programming the application to the Flash-memory

[Markus Klein](https://github.com/Masmiseim36) is helping with the development of this package.

- Using the latest CMSIS-Files and register-descriptions provided by [WIZnet](https://github.com/Wiznet/W7500x_StdPeriph_Lib)
- Added controller specific feature files
- Adding Support for the following devices

## Build and Install

The Package is provided unpacked and has to be packed before it can be installed. For this open the Project File located in the root of the project with the Crossworks IDE (File WIZnet.hzp). Then â€œcompile" it like a normal project (Build -> Build WIZnet). This will create the CPU-Support package in the root-Folder of the project (-> WIZnet.hzq).
To install the new created package, go to Tools -> Packages -> Manually Install Packages and choose the new File.
